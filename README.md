## üéØ Purpose and Goals of the Application
The multi-page application is designed for viewing images via the Unsplash API.

**Goals of the application:**

---

## üìù Brief Description of the Application

- Users can view each image individually and share links to them outside the application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Non-Functional Requirements

### üíª Technical Requirements
1. Authorization is implemented via Unsplash OAuth and a POST request to obtain an Auth Token.
2. The feed is implemented using `UITableView`.
3. The application uses `UIImageView`, `UIButton`, `UILabel`, `TabBarController`, `NavigationController`, `NavigationBar`, `UITableView`, and `UITableViewCell`.
4. The application must support iPhone devices with iOS 13 or higher, and only portrait mode is supported.
5. All fonts in the application are system fonts; no additional downloads are required. In Interface Builder, this is the "System" font from the dropdown list, and in code, it‚Äôs [`systemFont(ofSize:weight:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uifont/1619027-systemfont).

## ‚úÖ Functional Requirements

### üîê Authorization via OAuth

**Algorithms and available actions:**

2. After the application loads, the authorization screen appears.

      1. Clicking "Login" in the browser closes it, and a loading screen appears in the app.  
      2. If Unsplash OAuth authorization is not configured, clicking the login button does nothing.  
      3. If Unsplash OAuth authorization is incorrectly configured, the user cannot log into the app.  
      4. If the login attempt fails, a modal window with an error message appears.  
         1. Clicking "OK" returns the user to the authorization screen.  
      5. If authorization is successful, the browser closes, and the app opens the feed screen.
